This is the Tenth episode of Namaste React course by Akshay Saini.

In this episode first saw different ways of writing the css and also had the discussion regarding sass and scss. Then we saw different types of library and frameworks of css such as material ui, bootstrap, chakra ui. Then we saw tailwind css and used it in our project. The major advantage of tailwind is that we don't have navigate to different file to write css we just to specify the require class. And while bundling of code only required code is bundled into the file even we have repeated class hence reducing the file size. The only disadvantage here is that sometimes code may become large and difficult to read.
