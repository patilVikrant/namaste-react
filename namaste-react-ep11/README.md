This is the Eleventh episode of Namaste React course by Akshay Saini.

In this episode first saw what are higher order components. Higher order components are the components which takes components as a parameters and returns new component. We also created a feature which adds promoted to the restaurant cards in our app. Then we created a accordion and saw what are controlled component and uncontolled components. Uncontrolled components having their own state so controlling them from a single parent becomes difficult. Hence we lift the state up by giving the control to the common parent. Then we saw props drilling and the problem associated with it. Suppose we have to access the data from parents parent so we have pass the props from parent to child and then from child to granchild this is known as props drilling. This ok for some steps but if we have go further down then the code becomes unmaintenable. So we use context. We create our required context at a single place and we access that context using useContext hook. This context can be accessed from anywhere in our code without props drilling.
